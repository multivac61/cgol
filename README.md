CGOL
=================

CGOL is a python implementation of Conway's game of life.

How to use
-----------
The user can change three global variables: the size of the matrix, a time period in which the game should run by and the inital chance of life.

The changes of life
-----------
The program starts of by making a matrix at random using the user defined "chance of life" parameter and displays it in the console. Future life is then calculated after (Conway's rules)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life] and displays them in the console.
